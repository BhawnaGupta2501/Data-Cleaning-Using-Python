Here, I am sharing one of my projects in python: 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗨𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻!

In this project, I focused on cleaning and preprocessing data using powerful Python libraries like 𝗡𝘂𝗺𝗣𝘆, 𝗣𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘀, 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘁𝗹𝗶𝗯, and 𝗦𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗻. Here's a quick overview:

1. 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮:
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas.

2. 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 (𝗘𝗗𝗔):
- Identified and handled null values.
- Detected outliers using box plots and filtered them out.
- Analyzed relationships and variable dependencies with scatter plots and correlation matrices.

3. 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽𝘀:
- Imputed missing data.
- Removed outliers.
- Standardized data formats.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘀 𝗔𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗱:
- 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀: Identified and addressed missing values, ensuring a complete dataset for analysis.
- 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Corrected outliers and inconsistencies, enhancing data reliability and reducing errors.
- 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆: Resolved discrepancies for uniform interpretation of the dataset.
- 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀: Enabled more accurate and meaningful analyses with a clean dataset for informed decision-making.
- 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Produced clear, high-quality plots and charts to reveal patterns and trends

Thank You!
